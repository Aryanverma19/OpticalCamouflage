# OpticalCamouflage
A computer vision project that creates an invisibility cloak effect using OpenCV and Python. By detecting a specific color in real-time through webcam input, the program replaces that region with a background frame, making the user appear invisible.
# 🧥 Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV

Have you ever wished to own Harry Potter’s magical **Invisibility Cloak**?  
This project brings that illusion to life using **Python** and **OpenCV** by detecting a specific color in real-time and replacing it with the background, making you look invisible! 🎩✨

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time video capture through webcam.
- Detects a specific cloak color using HSV color space.
- Creates an “invisible effect” by replacing cloak pixels with the background.
- Customizable cloak color and thresholds.
- Lightweight, fun, and beginner-friendly computer vision project.

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Invisibility-Cloak.git
   cd Invisibility-Cloak
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python invisible_cloak.py
🎮 Usage
Make sure your webcam is connected.

Place yourself in front of the camera with the cloak (any solid color like red/blue/green).

The script will detect that color and replace it with the background frame, creating the invisibility effect.

Press q to quit the application.
